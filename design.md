## Design Decisions:
- Changed title font weight to bold to make it stick out more

For the design of our React To-Do List, we mainly took inspiration from the previous lab's static HTML/CSS To-Do List. However, this time, we utilized more of Professor Milburn's basic design principles.

Proximity:
As Professor Milburn stated, related elements should be grouped together. Thus, for the main functional buttons like the view filter and mass removal, we placed them together in a row above all of the list items. This way, useres know that the main buttons they will need to press are at the top. We placed our add item button (plus icon) in a different place, at the bottom, because we believed this made more sense to the user. If a user wants to add an item, it would be appended to the list, so naturally they would look at the bottom to click the add button.

Alignment:
Regarding alignment, all elements should line up with something else. We made sure that the functional buttons (view filter and mass removal) were aligned horizontally. Additionally, all the list items are aligned vertically and their icons are also aligned. Prof. Milburn warned that text that is cented-aligned is hard to read in blocks becuase of different start points for each line, so we decided to left-align the text within the list item. We placed the add button in the center since it is a relatively small button that would look awkward if right or left aligned.

Repetition:
Repetition states that some aspect of the design should be repeated throughout the project. In our case, we repeated the color scheme. Our main colors are a light blue and pink, and a secondary color is white. For our white list items, we had blue edit icons and pink delete icons. Furthermore, the style of the list item component was repeated thorughout, meaning every list item looks the same (except for their text descriptions). Additionally, we kept the same font and font sizes so that it looked organized/unified.

Contrast:
Professor Milburn's point about contrast was that, if things are not the same, then they should be very different. We employed this within our color scheme. Originally we were thinking of having two similar shades of blue as our primary colors. However, it looked odd because of how similar they were and thus we changed to have blue and pink as our colors.

Color Psychology:
Although not a design principle, we also though about Professor Milburn's explanation of the effects of color on a user. Our main colors, blue and pink, give off "trustworthy, comforting, relaxed" (blue) and "playful, innocent, youthful" (pink). We believe these are great traits for a to-do list that is aiming to be modern and used mainly by college students.

## Challenges:
Both of us have had a good amount of working with React, whether as side projects or in internships. Thus, the core concepts of React like state, props, etc. have been drilled into our brains. This made architecturing the app very straightforward. The most time-consuming part was CSS yet again, as creating the layout and accounting for things like text overflow were a bit annoying. However, we were able to reuse some parts of Lab 1's HTML/CSS.

## Parts Of Design We Are Proud Of:
We are proud of how we have more of a modern feel for our app. This effect is produced by our use of icons and rounded edges when possible for buttons and borders. The simplicity of the icons and buttons reduces clutter and makes the app more intuitive to users. We also employed some other techniques like box shadowing to draw user's attention to the important buttons like view filter and mass item removal.
